Syllabus for examination in 2015.7. Practical assessment Scientific subjects are, by their nature, experimental. So it is important that an assessment of a candidate’s knowledge and understanding of Chemistry should contain a practical component (see Assessment Objective C). Schools’ circumstances (e.g. the availability of resources) differ greatly, so three alternative ways of examining the practical component are provided. The three alternatives are:',
  '  Paper 4 – Coursework (school-based assessment)',
  '  Paper 5 – Practical Test',
  '  Paper 6 – Alternative to Practical (written paper).Whichever practical assessment route is chosen, the following points should be noted:',
  '  the same assessment objectives apply ',
  '  the same practical skills are to be learned and developed ',
  '  the same benefits to theoretical understanding come from all practical work',
  '  the same motivational effect, enthusiasm and enjoyment should be experienced',
  '  the same sequence of practical activities is appropriate.\nCurriculum content 28 Cambridge IGCSE Chemistry 0620. Syllabus for examination in 2015.7.1  Paper 4: Coursework Teachers may not undertake school-based assessment without the written approval of Cambridge. This will only be given to teachers who satisfy Cambridge requirements concerning moderation and they will have to undergo special training in assessment before entering candidates.Cambridge offers schools in-service training in the form of courses held at intervals in Cambridge and elsewhere, and also via distance training manuals.The experimental skills and abilities to be assessed are:C1  Using and organising techniques, apparatus and materialsC2  Observing, measuring and recordingC3  Handling experimental observations and data C4  Planning and evaluating investigations The four skills carry equal weighting.All assessments must be based on experimental work carried out by the candidates.It is expected that the teaching and assessment of experimental skills and abilities will take place throughout the course.Teachers must ensure that they can make available to Cambridge evidence of two assessments of each skill for each candidate. For skills C1 to C4 inclusive, information about the tasks set and how the marks were awarded will be required. In addition, for skills C2, C3 and C4, the candidate’s written work will also be required.The assessment scores finally recorded for each skill must represent the candidate’s best performances.For candidates who miss the assessment of a given skill through no fault of their own, for example because of illness, and who cannot be assessed on another occasion, Cambridge procedure for special consideration should be followed. However, candidates who for no good reason absent themselves from an assessment of a given skill should be given a mark of zero for that assessment.Criteria for assessment of experimental skills and abilitiesEach skill must be assessed on a six-point scale, level 6 being the highest level of achievement. Each of the skills is defined in terms of three levels of achievement at scores of 2, 4, and 6.A score of 0 is available if there is no evidence of positive achievement for a skill.For candidates who do not meet the criteria for a score of 2, a score of 1 is available if there is some evidence of positive achievement.A score of 3 is available for candidates who go beyond the level defined for 2, but who do not meet fully the criteria for 4.Similarly, a score of 5 is available for those who go beyond the level defined for 4, but do not meet fully the criteria for 6.\nCurriculum content 29Cambridge IGCSE Chemistry 0620. Syllabus for examination in 2015.Score Skill C1: Using and organising techniques, apparatus and materials0 No evidence of positive achievement for this skill.1 Some evidence of positive achievement, but the criteria for a score of 2 are not met.2 Follows written, diagrammatic or oral instructions to perform a single practical operation.Uses familiar apparatus and materials adequately, needing reminders on points of safety.3 Is beyond the level defined for 2, but does not meet fully the criteria for 4.4 Follows written, diagrammatic or oral instructions to perform an experiment involving a series of step-by-step practical operations.Uses familiar apparatus, materials and techniques adequately and safely.5 Is beyond the level defined for 4, but does not meet fully the criteria for 6.6 Follows written, diagrammatic or oral instructions to perform an experiment involving a series of practical operations where there may be a need to modify or adjust one step in the light of the effect of a previous step.Uses familiar apparatus, materials and techniques safely, correctly and methodically.Score Skill C2: Observing, measuring and recording0 No evidence of positive achievement for this skill.1 Some evidence of positive achievement, but the criteria for a score of 2 are not met.2 Makes observations or readings given detailed instructions.Records results in an appropriate manner given a detailed format.3 Is beyond the level defined for 2, but does not meet fully the criteria for 4.4 Makes relevant observations, measurements or estimates given an outline format or brief guidelines.Records results in an appropriate manner given an outline format.5 Is beyond the level defined for 4, but does not meet fully the criteria for 6.6 Makes relevant observations, measurements or estimates to a degree of accuracy appropriateto the instruments or techniques used.Records results in an appropriate manner given no format.\nCurriculum content 30 Cambridge IGCSE Chemistry 0620. Syllabus for examination in 2015.Score Skill C3: Handling experimental observations and data0 No evidence of positive achievement for this skill.1 Some evidence of positive achievement, but the criteria for a score of 2 are not met.2 Processes results in an appropriate manner given a detailed format.Draws an obvious qualitative conclusion from the results of an experiment.3 Is beyond the level defined for 2, but does not meet fully the criteria for 4.4 Processes results in an appropriate manner given an outline format.Recognises and comments on anomalous results.Draws qualitative conclusions which are consistent with obtained results and deduces patterns in data.5 Is beyond the level defined for 4, but does not meet fully the criteria for 6.6 Processes results in an appropriate manner given no format.Deals appropriately with anomalous or inconsistent results.Recognises and comments on possible sources of experimental error.Expresses conclusions as generalisations or patterns where appropriate.Score Skill C4: Planning and evaluating investigations0 No evidence of positive achievement for this skill.1 Some evidence of positive achievement, but the criteria for a score of 2 are not met.2 Suggests a simple experimental strategy to investigate a given practical problem.Attempts ‘trial and error’ modification in the light of the experimental work carried out.3 Is beyond the level defined for 2, but does not meet fully the criteria for 4.4 Specifies a sequence of activities to investigate a given practical problem.In a situation where there are two variables, recognises the need to keep one of them constant while the other is being changed.Comments critically on the original plan, and implements appropriate changes in the light of the experimental work carried out.5 Is beyond the level defined for 4, but does not meet fully the criteria for 6.6 Analyses a practical problem systematically and produces a logical plan for an investigation.In a given situation, recognises that there are a number of variables and attempts to control them.Evaluates chosen procedures, suggests/implements modifications where appropriate and shows a systematic approach in dealing with unexpected results.\nCurriculum content 31Cambridge IGCSE Chemistry 0620. Syllabus for examination in 2015.Guidance on candidate assessmentThe following notes are designed to help teachers make valid and reliable assessments of the skills and abilities of their candidates.',
  '  The assessments should be based on the principle of positive achievement: candidates should be given opportunities to demonstrate what they understand and can do.',
  '  It is expected that candidates will have had opportunities to acquire a given skill before assessment takes place.',
  '  It is not expected that all of the practical work undertaken by a candidate will be assessed.',
  '  Assessments can be carried out at any time during the course. However, at whatever stage assessments are done, the standards applied must be those expected at the end of the course, as exemplified in the criteria for the skills.',
  '  Assessments should normally be made by the person responsible for teaching the candidates.',
  '  A given practical task is unlikely to provide opportunities for all aspects of the criteria at a given level for a particular skill to be satisfied; for example, there may not be any anomalous results (Skill C3). However, by using a range of practical work, teachers should ensure that opportunities are provided for all aspects of the criteria to be satisfied during the course.',
  '  Extended experimental investigations are of great educational value. If such investigations are used for assessment purposes, teachers should make sure that the candidates have ample opportunity for displaying the skills and abilities required by the scheme of assessment.',
  '  It is not necessary for all candidates within a teaching group, or within a Centre, to be assessed on exactly the same practical work, although teachers can use work that is undertaken by all of their candidates.',
  '  When assessing group work, teachers must ensure that each candidate’s individual contribution is assessed.',
  '  Skill C1 might not generate a written product from the candidates; it will often be assessed by watching the candidates carrying out practical work.',
  '  Skills C2, C3 and C4 will usually generate a written product from the candidates; this will provide evidence for moderation.',
  '  Raw scores for individual practical assessments should be recorded on the Individual Candidate Record Card.

  '  Raw scores for individual practical assessments may be given to candidates as part of the normal feedback from the teacher. The final, internally moderated, total score should not be given to the candidate.\nCurriculum content 32 Cambridge IGCSE Chemistry 0620. Syllabus for examination in 2015.ModerationInternal moderationWhen several teachers in a Centre are involved in internal assessment, arrangements must be made within the Centre for all candidates to be assessed to the same standard. It is essential that the marks for each skill assigned within different teaching groups (or classes) are moderated internally for the whole Centre entry. The Centre assessments will then be moderated externally by Cambridge.External moderationExternal moderation of internal assessment is carried out by Cambridge. Centres must submit candidates’ internally assessed marks to Cambridge. The deadlines and methods for submitting internally assessed marks are in the Cambridge Administrative Guide available on our website.Once it has received the marks, Cambridge will draw up a list of sample candidates whose work will be moderated (a further sample may also be requested), and will ask the Centre to send immediately every piece of work that has contributed towards these candidates’ final marks. Individual Candidate Record Cards and Coursework Assessment Summary Forms must also be sent with the coursework. All remaining coursework and records should be kept by the Centre until results are published.Ideally, Centres should use loose-leaf A4 file paper for practical written work, as this is cheaper to send by post. Original work is preferred for moderation, but authenticated photocopies can be sent if absolutely necessary.Pieces of work for each skill should not be stapled together. Each piece of work should be clearly and securely labelled with:',

Syllabus for examination in 2015.8.5  Glossary of terms used in science papersThe glossary (which is relevant only to Science subjects) will prove helpful to candidates as a guide, but it is neither exhaustive nor definitive. The glossary has been deliberately kept brief, not only with respect to the number of terms included, but also to the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should appreciate that the meaning of a term must depend, in part, on its context.1.  Define (the term(s) … ) is intended literally, only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase being required.2.  What do you understand by/What is meant by (the term(s) … ) normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The amount of supplementary comment intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.3.  State implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument (e.g. a numerical answer that can readily be obtained ‘by inspection’).4.  List requires a number of points, generally each of one word, with no elaboration. Where a given number of points is specified this should not be exceeded.5.  Explain may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.6.  Describe requires the candidate to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. In the former instance, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena.In other contexts, describe should be interpreted more generally (i.e. the candidate has greater discretion about the nature and the organisation of the material to be included in the answer). Describe and explain may be coupled, as may state and explain.7.  Discuss requires the candidate to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.8.  Outline implies brevity (i.e. restricting the answer to giving essentials).9.  Predict implies that the candidate is not expected to produce the required answer by recall but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question or may depend on answers extracted in an earlier part of the question.Predict also implies a concise answer with no supporting statement required.10.  Deduce is used in a similar way to predict except that some supporting statement is required, e.g. reference to a law or principle, or the necessary reasoning is to be included in the answer.11.  Suggest is used in two main contexts, i.e. either to imply that there is no unique answer (e.g. in Chemistry, two or more substances may satisfy the given conditions describing an ‘unknown’), or to imply that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge of the subject to a ‘novel’ situation, one that may be formally ‘not in the syllabus’ – many data response and problem solving questions are of this type.12.  Find is a general term that may variously be interpreted as calculate, measure, determine, etc.13.  Calculate is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown, especially where two or more steps are involved.14.  Measure implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument (e.g. length, using a rule, or mass, using a balance).15.  Determine often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula e.g. relative molecular mass.\nAppendix A 40 Cambridge IGCSE Chemistry 0620. Syllabus for examination in 2015.16.  Estimate implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned, making such simplifying assumptions as may be necessary about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.17.  Sketch, when applied to graph work, implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct, but candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for (e.g. passing through the origin, having an intercept).In diagrams, sketch implies that simple, freehand drawing is acceptable; nevertheless, care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.8.6 Mathematical requirementsCalculators may be used in all parts of the examination.Candidates should be able to:',
  '  add, subtract, multiply and divide',
  '  use averages, decimals, fractions, percentages, ratios and reciprocals',

Complete any other sections of the form required.4.  Ensure that the addition of marks is independently checked.5.  It is essential that the marks of candidates from different teaching groups within each Centre are moderated internally. This means that the marks awarded to all candidates within a Centre must be brought to a common standard by the teacher responsible for co-ordinating the internal assessment (i.e. the internal moderator), and a single valid and reliable set of marks should be produced which reflects the relative attainment of all the candidates in the Coursework component at the Centre.6.  Transfer the marks to the Coursework Assessment Summary Form in accordance with the instructions given on that document.7.  Retain all Individual Candidate Record Cards and Coursework which will be required for external moderation.

Both the teacher completing the form and the internal moderator (or moderators) should check the form and complete and sign the bottom portion.B. Procedures for external moderation1.  University of Cambridge International Examinations sends a computer-printed Coursework mark sheet MS1 to each Centre (in late March for the June examination and in early October for the November examination) showing the names and index numbers of each candidate. Transfer the total internally moderated mark for each candidate from the Coursework Assessment Summary Form to the computer-printed Coursework mark sheet MS1.2.  The top copy of the computer-printed Coursework mark sheet MS1 must be despatched in the specially provided envelope. The deadlines and methods for submitting internally assessed marks are in the Cambridge Administrative Guide available on our website.3.  Cambridge will select a list of candidates whose work is required for external moderation. As soon as this list is received, send candidates’ work, with the corresponding Individual Candidate Record Cards, this summary form and the second copy of MS1, to Cambridge.4.  Experiment Forms, Work Sheets and Marking Schemes must be included for each task that has contributed to the final mark of these candidates.5.  Photocopies of the samples may be sent but candidates’ original work, with marks and comments from the teacher, is preferred.6. (a)  The pieces of work for each skill should not be stapled together, nor should individual sheets be enclosed in plastic wallets.(b)  Each piece of work should be clearly labelled with the skill being assessed, Centre name, candidate name and index number and the mark awarded. For each task, supply the information requested in B.4 above.7.

Other informationEquality and inclusionCambridge International Examinations has taken great care in the preparation of this syllabus and assessment materials to avoid bias of any kind. To comply with the UK Equality Act (2010), Cambridge has designed this qualification with the aim of avoiding direct and indirect discrimination.The standard assessment arrangements may present unnecessary barriers for candidates with disabilities or learning difficulties. Arrangements can be put in place for these candidates to enable them to access the assessments and receive recognition of their attainment. Access arrangements will not be agreed if they give candidates an unfair advantage over others or if they compromise the standards being assessed.Candidates who are unable to access the assessment of any component may be eligible to receive an award based on the parts of the assessment they have taken. Information on access arrangements is found in the Cambridge Handbook which can be downloaded from the website www.cie.org.ukLanguageThis syllabus and the associated assessment materials are available in English only.Grading and reportingCambridge IGCSE results are shown by one of the grades A*, A, B, C, D, E, F or G indicating the standard achieved, A* being the highest and G the lowest. ‘Ungraded’ indicates that the candidate’s performance fell short of the standard required for grade G. ‘Ungraded’ will be reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate. The letters Q (result pending); X (no results) and Y (to be issued) may also appear on the statement of results but not on the certificate.Entry codes To ma  intain the security of our examinations we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as ‘administrative zones’. Where the component entry code has two digits, the first digit is the component number given in the syllabus. The second digit is the location code, specific to an administrative zone.
